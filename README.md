# DevPatch
# Making Developers, Not Just Prompt-Generators

# 🚀 Inspiration

As students passionate about computer science and software development, we've noticed how easy it has become to rely on AI to write code for us. Many of our peers are falling into the trap of being prompt engineers rather than real developers.
With DevPatch, we aim to help students move away from AI dependency—while using AI. The goal is to create more skilled coders, not just AI-assisted developers.

# 🎯 What It Does

DevPatch is a web-based IDE that integrates:
A minimalist code editor with file management.
A messaging system with Bot—an AI that guides you while coding.
Bot never gives away the answer but provides tips, examples, and tricks to ensure you stay on track.
Bot actively analyzes your code, identifies errors, and suggests improvements while you work.
This ensures that students truly learn, rather than just relying on AI-generated solutions.

# 🛠 How We Built It

Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for an interactive UI.
Backend: Python with OpenAI’s API for AI-driven guidance.
Tech Stack:
Watchdog – Monitors file system changes.
Pytest – Simplifies writing and running test cases.
WebSockets – Enables real-time communication between the IDE and Bot.

# 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into

Building a functional IDE with a working terminal was our biggest challenge.
Debugging Bot’s logic and improving his guidance system required a lot of tweaking.

# 🏆 Accomplishments We’re Proud Of

Successfully integrating Bot’s real-time AI-powered feedback system.
Developing a clean, beginner-friendly IDE.
Using WebSockets for seamless real-time interactions between the user and Bot.

# 📚 What We Learned

Polishing the frontend first makes backend development easier.
Connecting WebSockets between the messaging system and Bot required a deep understanding of networking.

# 🔮 What’s Next for DevPatch?

More IDE features: Extensions, themes, and better file management.
Smarter AI guidance: A more refined active code monitoring system.
Expansion to other subjects: Using Computer Vision & Machine Learning for handwriting detection, making DevPatch useful for math & science education.
LMS Integration: Embedding DevPatch into platforms like Moodle, Blackboard, and Google Classroom.
Adaptive Learning Models: Analyzing student progress and adjusting AI explanations dynamically.
There are countless opportunities to scale DevPatch, and with enough time, this project will become something massive! 🚀
